These three readings will provide breadth and depth for this week:

* a very illuminating discussion prompted by a [piece](rhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/23113375?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by
  [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/) on the
  virtues of graphs relative to tables. When you read it, remember
  that it was written as

> a series of attacks on graphical methods in the voice of a
> hypothetical old-school analytical statistician or
> social scientist.

* Cleveland and McGill's [piece](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400) is famous for presenting
a very comprehensive treatment of _graphical perceptions_ as the
foundation to effective graphs. 

* a couple of chapters (5 - The Eye and the Visual Brain and 6 - Visualizing for the Mind)
from [Alberto Cairo's](http://albertocairo.com/)'s 
[The Functional Art](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1486761450&sr=1-3&keywords=alberto+cairo) to
  understand the cognitive aspect of visualizations as means to
  enhance their effectiveness in communicating information

# Complementary readings

Academics are not foreign to the benefits of summarizing information
through graphs.

* Nemi and Gelman also have a very nice
[piece](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/Niemi_GraphicsInformation.pdf)
(almost a cheatsheet) illustrating some very simple principles for
creating effective graphs. 
* Gelman, Passarica and Dodhia provide an early
[discussion](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/dodhia.pdf)
on the benefits of transforming tables into graphs, including some
very useful illustrations of their point. 
* Kastellac and Leoni have also a
[paper](http://jonathanrenshon.com/Teaching/NPS/ResearchDesign/Using%20Graphs%20Instead%20of%20Tables.pdf)
making a similar case with additional examples.
* Weiner's [piece](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2683253) exhibits "12 principles" for bad data visualization. 



## Book-length treatments

It's never a bad idea to go back to the classics to get interesting
ideas.

* Tufte's books:
  [The Visual Display of Quantitative
  Information](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1486764971&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Visual+Display+of+Quantitative+Information),

  Art](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1486761450&sr=1-3&keywords=alberto+cairo)

# Additional resources

Perhaps one of the most used R packages to create graphs is
[ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/). Its main page is
extensively documented, and you'll be able to find most answers on
what you can do and how you can do it in ggplot2. Of course, among
RStudio's
[cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) you'll
be able to find one for ggplot2.

For a more extensive treatment, you can go directly to the source with
Wickham's
[ggplot book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387981403/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=ggplot2-20)
and consult the [companion site](http://ggplot2.org/book/) for code examples. Also, keep your
[R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do) handy.

Choosing colors is perhaps one of the hardest parts of creating good
graphs. At least it is for me. When in doubt, consult [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) for some color advice that
goes beyond maps. A companion
[paper](http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=8c41dcff-9c3e-43b2-ab04-abe282d08bc4%40sessionmgr104&vid=0&hid=128&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=10090904&db=a9h)
is also available and a worthy read.

## Dos and don'ts

There are also many suggestions out there for what (not) to do with
graphs. A few interesting resources

* [Hyndman's](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/graphics/) recommended
principles for graphing
* some comments from the
  [Calling Bullshit course](http://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html)
  on graph axes
* many good pieces of advice from Karl Broman; check his
  [site](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/) regularly for good
  graph advice
