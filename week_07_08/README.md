* a very illustrative [piece](http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/23723482?pq-origsite=summon&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by
  [Hal Varian](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/) providing a 
  re-look at ML techniques from the perspective of a 
  social scientist originally trained in econometrics. In a way, bridging the gap between what might appear as two separate worlds.  

# Complementary readings

I am assuming that you have your econometrics ready to deploy, but a quick brush-up never hurt anyone.  

Please take some time to refresh your matrix algebra for 
this week. A favorite go to resource is Bill Greene's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386), 
especially Appendices A and C. We will be working with matrices
when computing and graphing interactions, so you'll be much better
off having a quck brush up.

Also, you might want to go back to [ESL II](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) to get a quick refresher on random forests, and related methods.
