# Required Readings

* a [piece](http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ss/1294167961) by Shmueli going deep on the differences between modeling for explanation vs prediction  which are not often spelled out with pristine clarity. A very interesting discussion - both philosophical and empirical - of these differences.

These three readings synthesize much of the current state of the art on what we know about prediction/forecasting:

* a [piece](https://repository.upenn.edu/marketing_papers/146/?utm_source=repository.upenn.edu%2Fmarketing_papers%2F146&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages) by J. Scott Armstrong providing steps and principles to evaluate forecasts based on dense stack of academic research. 
* another [piece](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&context=marketing_papers) by Armstrong on the empirical differences between fitting models and generating predictions/forecasts
* make sure to skim through this [piece](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315001459) by Armstrong and colleagues compiling principles that summarize current knowledge on forecasting

# Complementary readings

Time permitting, we'll be focusing for part of this week on *time series forecasting*; a few refresher readings

### Time-Series Forecasting

A great many forecasts of human behavior require models that rely on time series: behavior is usually patterned and many times cyclical or seasonal. If you need a refresher on Time Series forecasting, you can start by reading this nice retrospect: [25 Years of Time Series Forecasting](http://dx.doi.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.01.001). Also, make sure to look into [Forecasting: principles and practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) for an intro-level book-length reference, or [Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/research-methods-politics/time-series-analysis-social-sciences?format=PB&isbn=9780521691550) for a deeper book-length treatment.

For a more advanced treatment of the theory underlying Time Series, you can always go to [Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/econometric-analysis-cross-section-and-panel-data) or [Econometric Analysis](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Greene-Econometric-Analysis-7th-Edition/PGM305107.html).

An often referenced, but not always fully understood concept in time-series forecasting is it's decomposition. If curious, you'll profit from reading this [paper on STL](http://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf) which is a Loess-based decomposition method that is widely used today. There are other methods out there, but this would explain the mechanics with a much clarity.
