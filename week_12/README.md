# Required readings

This reading will provide breadth and depth for this week:

* a path-breaking [piece](http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/25791835?pq-origsite=summon&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
  by [Brambor](http://thomas.brambor.com/), [Clark](https://pols.tamu.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/william-r-clark-charles-puryear-professor-of-liberal-arts/) and [Golder](http://mattgolder.com/) on interactions. It's undoubtedly
  one of the least understood tools in statistical analyses,
  despite being the bread and butter to address the types of
  questions that social scientists typically ask.

# Complementary readings

There is a number of resources that delve deep into interactions and interactive effects:
* Bill Greene's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386)
* Kam and Franzese's [book](https://www.press.umich.edu/206871/modeling_and_interpreting_interactive_hypotheses_in_regression_analysis)
* a site created by Matt Golder, for all things [Interactions](http://mattgolder.com/interactions)

Please take some time to refresh your matrix algebra for
this week. A favorite go to resource is Bill Greene's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386),
especially Appendices A and C. We will be working with matrices
when computing and graphing interactions, so you'll be much better
off having a quick brush up.
