# Required readings

Data Science remains a very nebulous concept with a very fluid definition, perhaps for the best. While there is no agreed upon definition, we must talk a bit about it. For this week you should read:

* this
[piece](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf) by David Donoho discussing data science (and statistics). An incredibly relevant piece for Social Scientists to read as they head into the world of
Data Science. 
* take also a few minutes to read Drew Conway's [original post](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) on the Data Science Venn Diagram ...and since this is week 2, keep going on this [compilation](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html) of iterations on the same idea. 

This week we will also be discussing a few topics related to best practices in contemporary data science. A few additional resources below.


### Creating DS project structures

People have put thought into standardizing project creation practices in Data Science, to the point of automating the creation of projects in ways that are generic and flexible enough to encompass multiple use cases. Two very useful ones are [Cookiecutter for Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) tailored for Python, and  [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) developed for R. 

While you may or may not want to use them to create your projects, they are certainly a rich source of food for thought on what needs to be considered when creating a Data Science project.

As [Cookiecutter](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#be-conservative-in-changing-the-default-folder-structure) would put it: "be _liberal_ in changing the folders around for your project, but be _conservative_ in changing the default structure for all projects."


### R

If you are taking this course, you are not new to R. But if you need a handy refresher, make sure to revisit some of these resources:

* [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
* [R Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)

Even if you're not new to R, you may have started to encounter things you simply cannot understand. Do not despair, there is a way out of the [_The R Inferno_](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf). If you want to delve deeper into the structure of R to leverage it better with your coding, make sure to consult the first few chapters of [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)

### Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a very common communication tool in the DS world, especially appreciated for its ability to integrate with a number of tools and applications. 

Although it is pretty intuitive to use, but it never hurts to browse their [Getting Started](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768) and [New Members](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members) pages. 

Slack works on Markdown, so you may want to check out some [gimmicks](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) to format your messages. 

You may also want to explore [one](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054413/know-it-all/everything-you-are-afraid-to-ask-about-slack-etiquette) or [two](https://gist.github.com/chandracarney/f3c3e62bdeff75826d07) pieces commenting on Slack etiquette.
