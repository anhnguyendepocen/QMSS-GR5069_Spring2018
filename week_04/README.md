# Suggested readings

GitHub has done a great job of putting together and facilitating resources to make it easy to use (once you've understood it). It's not entirely
intuitive at first, so you may want to start with some of these resources, and immediately get to play around with it.

* [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/) is a great place to start at the source
* [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) which is a perfect intro to GitHub
* [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) a hands-on tutorial put together by CodeSchool and GitHub
* the YouTube channel [GitHub training series](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
* [Git Cheatsheets](https://services.github.com/on-demand/resources/cheatsheets/) put together by the GitHub team
* [Git Pro book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if you're getting really serious about Git

It's also quite simple to integrate GitHub with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), you can read more in [Chapter 13](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)
of _R Packages_.
