## Data Challenge 1 (due on 2/14 at 6PM)


At the end of January 2017, the [Drug Policy Program (PPD)](http://www.politicadedrogas.org/) at CIDE, a public university in Mexico, released a dataset that allegedly expands on a database that the Mexican government released with data on executions, confrontations, and aggressions related to alleged members of organized crime that happened between 2006-2010. Upon releasing this new data, PPD's director concludes that  

> 86.1% of dead civilians who presumably participated in confrontations with federal armed forces were killed in events of "perfect lethality" where there were only dead and no wounded. [...] Mexico has the terrible situation of having lethality indices of 2.6. The lethality index of the Federal Police is 2.6 dead for every wounded, the Navy's reaches 17.3 dead for every wounded, and the Army's is 9.1 dead for every wounded. 

The lethality index is defined as the ratio of dead over wounded per event. 


With this new dataset, please address the following: 

1. Can you replicate the 86.1% number? the overall lethality ratio? the ratios for the Federal Police, Navy and Army? 
    * Provide a visualization that presents this information neatly. 
    * Please show the exact computations you used to calculate them (most likely than not, you'll need to do some additional munging in the data to get there)
    * If you could not replicate them, please show why and the difference relative to your own computations (also, include a neat graph that summarizes this)
	* Be very explicit: What are you assuming to generate these computations?

2. Now you know the data more intimately. Think a little bit more about it, and answer the following questions:
  * Is this the right metric to look at? Why or why not? 
  * What is the "lethality index" showing explicitly? What is it not showing? What is the definition assuming?
  * With the same available data, can you think of an alternative way to capture the same construct? Is it "better"? 
  * What additional information would you need to better understand the data?
  * What additional information could help you better capture the construct behind the "lethality index"

Please create a file on your team GitHub repo where you answer the challenge, including links to your code, graphs.
